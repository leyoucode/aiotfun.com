A 170mm square board. 270 grams. 180 TOPS of combined AI compute. Avalue's EMX-PTLP is one of the first industrial mini-ITX boards to ship with Intel's Panther Lake-H silicon, and the spec sheet reads like someone confused "embedded" with "workstation."

## What's Under the Hood

The headliner is Intel's Core Ultra 7 358H — 16 cores (4 Performance, 8 Efficiency, 4 Low Power Efficiency), turbo to 4.8 GHz, all on a 25W base power budget. Laptop-class power draw, desktop-class core count.

The AI numbers need context. That "180 TOPS" comes from three engines working together: a 50 TOPS NPU (Intel's new NPU5 with sparsity support) for sustained low-power inference — think always-on defect detection on a factory line. A 122 TOPS GPU (Intel Arc B390, Xe3 architecture) for burst workloads like running a local LLM. And about 10 TOPS from the CPU itself. Two chip generations ago, Intel's Meteor Lake NPU delivered just 11 TOPS. That's a nearly 5x jump in NPU alone.

The board doesn't cut corners either. Two M.2 NVMe slots with PCIe 5.0 and RAID. Up to 64GB DDR5-7200. Dual Ethernet (2.5GbE + Gigabit). Five RS-232 serial ports. A SIM card slot for cellular connectivity. And the real surprise: a PCIe Gen 5 x8 expansion slot — unusual on a thin mini-ITX, and it means you can add a discrete AI accelerator on top of the built-in 180 TOPS when your workload demands it.

Four independent display outputs (HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort 1.4a, two USB-C) round out a board that clearly targets machine vision, robotic control, and industrial AI inference.

## The Playing Field

The EMX-PTLP isn't alone. AAEON's UP Xtreme PTL Edge, ASRock Industrial's NUC Ultra 300, and Vecow's stackable TGS-2000 all pack Panther Lake-H with similar TOPS numbers. NVIDIA's Jetson AGX Orin still leads on raw AI throughput at 275 TOPS, but costs $1,599 for the dev kit and locks you into the CUDA ecosystem. Intel's pitch: x86 compatibility and OpenVINO mean your existing software stack probably just works — no ARM porting headaches, no new toolchain to learn.

## What Engineers Are Saying

The board is too new for in-depth community review — mass production isn't until Q3 2026 — but it's already turning heads. "That is one sexy looking motherboard," one reader commented on Liliputing. "Too bad it's an industrial PC brand and it's most likely an expensive board."

On Hacker News, the broader Panther Lake discussion has been spirited. "Intel-based chip that's on par with Apple Silicon is much desired," noted user orev, pointing out that Windows still doesn't run natively on Macs. User bryanlarsen countered AMD skeptics: "You don't get 22 hours of battery life out of a Ryzen laptop."

## Why It Matters

Two years ago, 180 TOPS of AI inference meant a discrete GPU pulling hundreds of watts. Now it fits on a board the size of a napkin at 25W base power. For shops already running x86 stacks, the leap from cloud inference to on-premise AI just got dramatically shorter.

Fair warning: pricing is undisclosed (Avalue is an industrial vendor — expect quotes, not Amazon listings), and that Q3 2026 timeline means this is still a "coming soon." But the direction is clear — edge AI hardware is entering a phase where the compute is no longer the bottleneck.
