## The Jetson Lineup Gets Affordable
NVIDIA has been the king of GPU-accelerated edge computing for a while, but the Jetson lineup has always had a price problem. The original Orin Nano started at $499 — great for industrial applications, but too expensive for hobbyists and students. The new revision changes everything.

## Specs at a Glance
- **GPU:** 1024 CUDA cores + 32 Tensor cores
- **CPU:** 6-core Arm Cortex-A78AE
- **AI Performance:** Up to 67 TOPS (INT8)
- **Memory:** 8GB LPDDR5 with 102 GB/s bandwidth
- **Storage:** M.2 NVMe slot
- **Price:** $249 (developer kit)

## Benchmark Results
We ran our standard edge AI benchmark suite across several popular models:

The highlights: YOLOv8n runs at **145 FPS** at 640×640 resolution. Whisper-tiny transcribes at **12x real-time**. Stable Diffusion generates a 512×512 image in **8 seconds**. These numbers put it firmly in the "capable workstation" category for edge AI development.

## Who Should Buy This?
If you're building anything that needs serious on-device AI — robotics, smart cameras, local LLM inference, real-time object detection — the new Orin Nano is the sweet spot of price and performance. It's not the cheapest board out there, but it's the most capable one under $300 by a wide margin.
