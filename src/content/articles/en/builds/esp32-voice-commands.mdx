## Why Local Voice Recognition Matters
For years, voice-controlled IoT devices have relied on cloud services — send audio to a server, wait for processing, get a response. It works, but it's slow, privacy-invasive, and falls apart without internet. This project changes that.
Built by a community of open-source enthusiasts, this ESP32-based system runs a quantized language model entirely on-device. The result? Real-time voice command recognition with zero cloud dependency.

## The Hardware Setup
The build is surprisingly accessible:
- **ESP32-S3** with 8MB PSRAM — the brain of the operation
- **INMP441** I2S MEMS microphone — captures audio at 16kHz
- **MAX98357A** I2S amplifier + speaker — for audio feedback
- Total cost: under $15 in components

## How the Model Works
The team used a heavily quantized version of a small transformer model (just 2M parameters) trained specifically on command phrases. The model runs inference in under 200ms on the ESP32-S3's dual-core processor.
```
// Example: Registering a voice command
voice_cmd_register("turn on lights", [](void) {
    gpio_set_level(RELAY_PIN, HIGH);
    audio_play("lights_on.wav");
});

voice_cmd_register("set timer", [](void) {
    start_timer(DEFAULT_DURATION);
    audio_play("timer_started.wav");
});
```

## Real-World Performance
We tested it in a typical living room environment with background noise from a TV. The recognition accuracy was impressive:
- Quiet environment: **94% accuracy**
- Moderate background noise: **87% accuracy**
- Loud environment: **71% accuracy**
Not perfect, but remarkably good for a $15 device running everything locally.

## What's Next
The project roadmap includes wake-word detection, multi-language support, and a web-based training interface for custom commands. The GitHub repo already has over 2,000 stars and growing.
