## The Promise of Local LLMs
Running a large language model on a Raspberry Pi sounds like a party trick — fun to demo, but not really usable. With the Pi 5's improved specs and the latest quantization techniques, we wanted to see if that's still true in 2026.

## Test Setup
We tested three quantized versions of Llama 2 on a Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB RAM):
- **Llama 2 7B Q4_K_M** — 4-bit quantized, 4.1GB
- **Llama 2 7B Q2_K** — 2-bit quantized, 2.7GB
- **TinyLlama 1.1B Q8_0** — 8-bit quantized, 1.1GB

## Results
```
Model               | Tokens/sec | RAM Usage | Quality
--------------------|------------|-----------|--------
Llama 2 7B Q4_K_M   | 2.8 t/s    | 5.2GB     | Good
Llama 2 7B Q2_K     | 4.1 t/s    | 3.6GB     | Fair
TinyLlama 1.1B Q8_0 | 11.3 t/s   | 1.8GB     | Decent
```

## The Verdict
Is it usable? **It depends.** For interactive chat, even 4 tokens/second feels painfully slow. But for batch processing tasks — summarizing text, classifying inputs, generating structured data — it's surprisingly practical. TinyLlama at 11 tokens/second is genuinely usable for simple tasks.
The Pi 5 isn't replacing your GPU server anytime soon, but edge LLM inference has gone from "impossible" to "surprisingly workable" in just two years.
