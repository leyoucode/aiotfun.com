## Smart Home Without a Grid

When most of us lose internet, we just wait it out. In Ukraine, power grid failures are a regular occurrence due to the ongoing conflict, and "waiting it out" isn't always an option. As the builder explained on Reddit: "Russia regularly attacks our power grid — when it goes down, internet and cell towers follow within hours. My Home Assistant keeps running on battery backup, but I can't reach it from outside. **So I built a radio bridge.**"

The setup uses **Meshtastic**, an open-source mesh networking platform built on LoRa (Long Range) radio modules. These tiny boards form a self-healing mesh network that can relay messages over impressive distances — 1 to 3 km in urban areas with stock antennas, and the community has pushed ground-to-ground links as far as **331 km**.

## How It Works

The architecture is surprisingly straightforward. A Meshtastic node near the Home Assistant server connects via MQTT, acting as a gateway between the LoRa mesh and the home automation system. Remote nodes let you send commands and receive status updates from anywhere in the mesh network's range.

The clever bit: to work within LoRa's bandwidth constraints, sensor data gets **bit-packed into 32 bytes** per transmission. That's enough to carry temperature readings, switch states, and basic control commands — everything you need to keep the lights on (literally) when everything else goes dark.

## More Than Just Home Automation

The build taps into a much larger network. Ukraine's Meshtastic community has built an extensive mesh that goes far beyond smart home control. The same infrastructure relays **air strike warnings** to communities that might otherwise miss them during blackouts.

A public dashboard at mesh.in.ua shows the real-time network activity, with privacy protections that randomize node locations to a 5.8 km radius. The network keeps growing because Meshtastic has a killer feature: **nodes forward packets even if they can't decrypt them**, as long as they're on the same channel. Every new node extends range for everyone.

## Hardware Choices

The community has settled on a few preferred setups:

- **T-Echo** — Popular and affordable, but drains battery even when "off" (not ideal for always-on deployment)
- **RAK4631 with solar panel** — The long-term winner. One user reported a full year of continuous uptime on solar power alone
- **ESP32 + LoRa modules** — Budget-friendly DIY option for those comfortable with soldering

## What the Community Said

The post hit Reddit's r/homeassistant with 775 upvotes and spilled over to Hacker News. The reactions were visceral.

"Oh man... this is really truly inspiring! The true hacker spirit. Practically cyberpunk," wrote one HN commenter. Another called it "the hacker way — well done to the strong and hearty Ukrainians making solutions for complicated times." On Reddit, a user summed it up simply: "This is one of the coolest integrations I've seen for a while." Another said: "Now THIS is a reason for me to look into Meshtastic."

What surprised people most was how much the builder automated beyond basic switches. The setup includes a voice messaging feature — type `SAY:` on the radio and a speaker reads it aloud at home. Camera snapshots get analyzed by a local vision model that returns text descriptions over LoRa. And all the integration code? "OpenClaw wrote it and I haven't even seen the code," the builder admitted. "I just tested if everything works as I want."

## Why This Hits Different

There's no shortage of LoRa hobby projects out there, but this one isn't a hobby. It's a real person keeping their home running during a real crisis using open-source hardware and software that anyone can replicate. The fact that the same mesh network doubles as a community early warning system makes it one of the most impactful DIY IoT builds we've seen.

Sometimes the most impressive engineering isn't about pushing performance numbers — it's about keeping things working when everything around you is falling apart.
