## Smart Home Without a Grid

When most of us lose internet, we just wait it out. In Ukraine, power grid failures are a regular occurrence due to the ongoing conflict, and "waiting it out" isn't always an option. One resourceful maker found a way to keep their Home Assistant smart home running over LoRa radio — no internet connection, no grid power required.

The setup uses **Meshtastic**, an open-source mesh networking platform built on LoRa (Long Range) radio modules. These tiny boards form a self-healing mesh network that can relay messages over impressive distances — 1 to 3 km in urban areas with stock antennas, and the community has pushed ground-to-ground links as far as **331 km**.

## How It Works

The architecture is surprisingly straightforward. A Meshtastic node near the Home Assistant server connects via MQTT, acting as a gateway between the LoRa mesh and the home automation system. Remote nodes let you send commands and receive status updates from anywhere in the mesh network's range.

The clever bit: to work within LoRa's bandwidth constraints, sensor data gets **bit-packed into 32 bytes** per transmission. That's enough to carry temperature readings, switch states, and basic control commands — everything you need to keep the lights on (literally) when everything else goes dark.

## More Than Just Home Automation

The build taps into a much larger network. Ukraine's Meshtastic community has built an extensive mesh that goes far beyond smart home control. The same infrastructure relays **air strike warnings** to communities that might otherwise miss them during blackouts.

A public dashboard at mesh.in.ua shows the real-time network activity, with privacy protections that randomize node locations to a 5.8 km radius. The network keeps growing because Meshtastic has a killer feature: **nodes forward packets even if they can't decrypt them**, as long as they're on the same channel. Every new node extends range for everyone.

## Hardware Choices

The community has settled on a few preferred setups:

- **T-Echo** — Popular and affordable, but drains battery even when "off" (not ideal for always-on deployment)
- **RAK4631 with solar panel** — The long-term winner. One user reported a full year of continuous uptime on solar power alone
- **ESP32 + LoRa modules** — Budget-friendly DIY option for those comfortable with soldering

## Why This Hits Different

There's no shortage of LoRa hobby projects out there, but this one isn't a hobby. It's a real person keeping their home running during a real crisis using open-source hardware and software that anyone can replicate. The fact that the same mesh network doubles as a community early warning system makes it one of the most impactful DIY IoT builds we've seen.

Sometimes the most impressive engineering isn't about pushing performance numbers — it's about keeping things working when everything around you is falling apart.
