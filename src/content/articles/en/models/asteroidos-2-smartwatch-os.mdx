## Ten Years to a Real Alternative

AsteroidOS started in 2016 when developer Florent Revest got basic functionality running on an LG G Watch. Version 1.0 arrived in 2018 with support for just 4 watches. Now, eight years later, **AsteroidOS 2.0** lands with support for approximately **30 devices** — and it actually looks like a usable daily driver.

This is a fully open-source, Linux-based operating system for smartwatches. No Google account required. No telemetry. No app store harvesting your data. Just a watch that tells time, tracks your steps, and lets you read notifications.

## What's New in 2.0

The update reads less like a point release and more like the version where AsteroidOS stopped being a tech demo. **Always-on display** with tilt-to-wake and palm-to-sleep means it finally behaves like a real watch — you don't have to tap the screen every time you want to check the time. **Heart rate monitoring** and **step counting** cover the two features most people actually want from a smartwatch. **Bluetooth audio** support means you can control music from your wrist without needing a Google account.

The smaller additions add up: nightstand mode turns it into a bedside clock, a compass app appeared, and the language count jumped from 29 to **49** — a sign that translators around the world are actively contributing. The UI got a full overhaul with a new QuickPanel, smoother round-display rendering, and seven new launcher styles. Battery life improved too, though the team hasn't published specific numbers.

## Supported Hardware

The device list went from "a few LG watches" to covering most of the Wear OS graveyard. **Fossil** Gen 4 through 6, the **TicWatch** lineup (nearly every model), **Huawei** Watch 1 and 2, the entire **LG** G Watch family, all three **Asus** ZenWatches, **Sony** Smartwatch 3, **OPPO** Watch, and various **MTK6580-based** Chinese watches. About 30 devices total, with more in experimental support including Casio and Samsung Gear models.

That breadth matters because most of these watches were abandoned by their manufacturers years ago. A Fossil Gen 4 running Wear OS is a dead end — running AsteroidOS, it's a functional Linux computer on your wrist.

## The Technical Stack

AsteroidOS uses **QML and Qt** for its UI layer with C/C++ for hardware-level work. Synchronization works across platforms through multiple companion apps: AsteroidOS Sync (Android), Gadgetbridge (Android), Amazfish (SailfishOS/Linux), and Telescope (Ubuntu Touch).

That cross-platform sync story is something even Wear OS struggles with. Your old Android watch can sync with a Linux phone — that's pretty unusual.

## What the Community Thinks

The Show HN thread pulled in a mix of excitement and honest frustration. One user immediately planned to flash it on a Fossil Gen 6 to "bring the watch back from the dead." Another called the project "seriously impressive" and said the gesture responsiveness compared favorably to Samsung's interface.

But not everyone found their watch on the list. "Neither of my Samsung watches are supported," lamented a Lemmy user. A Hacker News commenter was disappointed the Galaxy Watch 4 didn't make the cut. Another joked about having "a superpower for buying unsupported hardware" — a familiar feeling for anyone in the alternative OS world.

The most telling sign that people are actually daily-driving this: a long-time user filed bug reports and feature requests (WiFi improvements, a stopwatch bug) directly in the HN thread. When someone questioned whether Qt/QML was too heavy for a watch, an AsteroidOS developer responded that Qt is "quite lean and fast" compared to Android Wear. Perhaps the best reframing came from a commenter who argued the point isn't competing with Wear OS — it's **extending the lifespan of abandoned smartwatches** beyond their manufacturer's support window.

## Why Put It in the "Models" Category?

AsteroidOS isn't a language model, but it fits the spirit of what we track in this category: open-source software frameworks that push the boundaries of what embedded devices can do. It's a complete operating system — UI toolkit, hardware abstraction, sync protocol — running on hardware its manufacturers abandoned years ago.

## The Bigger Picture

The smartwatch market is dominated by Apple and Google. Both ecosystems are locked down, subscription-hungry, and designed to keep you buying new hardware. AsteroidOS is the opposite: it gives new life to watches that would otherwise be e-waste, with full user control and zero cloud dependency.

The project is actively looking for contributors — C programmers for hardware ports, QML/Qt developers, translators, and testers. If you've got an old smartwatch collecting dust, it might be time to flash something new onto it.
