## Ten Years to a Real Alternative

AsteroidOS started in 2016 when developer Florent Revest got basic functionality running on an LG G Watch. Version 1.0 arrived in 2018 with support for just 4 watches. Now, eight years later, **AsteroidOS 2.0** lands with support for approximately **30 devices** — and it actually looks like a usable daily driver.

This is a fully open-source, Linux-based operating system for smartwatches. No Google account required. No telemetry. No app store harvesting your data. Just a watch that tells time, tracks your steps, and lets you read notifications.

## What's New in 2.0

The feature list is substantial:

- **Always-on display** with tilt-to-wake and palm-to-sleep gestures
- **Heart rate monitoring** app
- **Step counting** support
- **Music volume control** from the wrist
- **Compass** functionality
- **Bluetooth HID and Audio** support
- **Nightstand mode** for bedside clock display
- **49 language translations** (up from 29 in v1.0)
- Seven new app launcher styles, redesigned weather and timer apps, plus a calculator, flashlight, and a "Diamonds" puzzle game

The UI has been overhauled with a new QuickPanel, improved round-display rendering, and smoother animations. Battery life has also improved, though specific numbers aren't published.

## Supported Hardware

The device list has gone from niche to genuinely broad:

- **Fossil** Gen 4, 5, and 6
- **Huawei** Watch and Watch 2
- **TicWatch** C2, C2+, E, S, E2, S2, Pro, Pro 2020/LTE, Pro 3
- **LG** G Watch, G Watch Urbane, G Watch R, Watch W7
- **Asus** ZenWatch 1, 2, 3
- **Sony** Smartwatch 3
- **OPPO** Watch
- **Polar** M600
- **Moto** 360 (2015)
- Various **MTK6580-based** devices

Several more are in experimental support, including Casio WSD-F10/F20 and Samsung Gear models.

## The Technical Stack

AsteroidOS uses **QML and Qt** for its UI layer with C/C++ for hardware-level work. Synchronization works across platforms through multiple companion apps: AsteroidOS Sync (Android), Gadgetbridge (Android), Amazfish (SailfishOS/Linux), and Telescope (Ubuntu Touch).

That cross-platform sync story is something even Wear OS struggles with. Your old Android watch can sync with a Linux phone — that's pretty unusual.

## Why Put It in the "Models" Category?

AsteroidOS isn't a language model, but it fits the spirit of what we track in this category: open-source software frameworks that push the boundaries of what embedded devices can do. It's a complete operating system — UI toolkit, hardware abstraction, sync protocol — running on hardware its manufacturers abandoned years ago.

## The Bigger Picture

The smartwatch market is dominated by Apple and Google. Both ecosystems are locked down, subscription-hungry, and designed to keep you buying new hardware. AsteroidOS is the opposite: it gives new life to watches that would otherwise be e-waste, with full user control and zero cloud dependency.

The project is actively looking for contributors — C programmers for hardware ports, QML/Qt developers, translators, and testers. If you've got an old smartwatch collecting dust, it might be time to flash something new onto it.
