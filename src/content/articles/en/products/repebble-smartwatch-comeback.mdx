## The Watch That Refused to Die

Pebble raised $10.3 million on Kickstarter in 2012 — the platform's biggest campaign at the time — and shipped the first smartwatch that worked with both Android and iOS. It sold over 2 million units. Then in December 2016, it ran out of money and sold its IP to Fitbit for a sad $23 million. Fitbit took the patents and code; Google later absorbed both through the Fitbit acquisition in 2021.

That should have been the end. Instead, a volunteer community called **Rebble** kept dead Pebble watches functional for **nine years** by replacing the shut-down cloud services. And the original founder, Eric Migicovsky, kept wearing his Pebble every day for a decade.

In January 2025, Google open-sourced PebbleOS. By March, Migicovsky launched **Core Devices** and announced new hardware at rePebble.com. The **Pebble Time 2** enters mass production on **March 9, 2026**, with first deliveries in early April. This isn't a concept or a promise — hundreds of production verification units have already been manufactured and tested.

## What Makes Pebble Different (Still)

In a market where Apple Watch lasts 18 hours and Galaxy Watch manages about 40, the Pebble Time 2 promises **up to 30 days** on a single charge. That's not a typo. The secret is the same as the original: a **color e-paper display** that's always on, sunlight-readable, and sips power instead of guzzling it.

The Pebble Time 2 ships with a 1.5-inch color e-paper touchscreen (64 colors, 200x228), stainless steel frame, heart rate monitor, two microphones for voice replies, and **30m water resistance**. It has four physical buttons — which means you can skip tracks with gloves on, without looking at your wrist. The entire OS is open source under Apache 2.0, and the native app store carries **15,000+ watchfaces and apps** from the original Pebble ecosystem.

There's also the **Pebble Round 2** ($199, shipping May 2026) — a thinner, bezel-free redesign with two-week battery — and the **Index 01** ($75), a smart ring that captures voice memos with on-device processing, no cloud required, running on replaceable hearing aid batteries that last roughly **two years**.

## What the Community Is Saying

The Hacker News thread on the February production update drew the kind of emotional responses you rarely see for a gadget. "Not a single damn wearable I've had has captured a fraction of the charm the original Pebble and Pebble Time had," wrote user dag11. Another called 30-day battery life "honestly a dream."

The pre-order excitement is real. "I've preordered the Core Time 2, I'm so incredibly excited that you've resurrected Pebble," wrote girvo. One user confessed: "My family and friends are sick of my decade-long attachment to my Pebble Steel."

But there's healthy skepticism too. "The delay from December to April is pretty sizable, and it makes me take all of their current estimates with a huge grain of salt," cautioned one commenter. Others questioned whether a small, self-funded company can deliver at scale, noted the 30-day warranty (which may not even be EU-legal), and pointed out missing features like NFC payment that modern users expect.

There's also a tension between Core Devices and the Rebble community that kept Pebble alive for nine years — a dispute over legacy app data and app store control that hasn't fully resolved. The open-source ethos cuts both ways: it gave Pebble its second life, but sharing the fruits of community labor isn't always straightforward.

## The $225 Question

The Pebble Time 2 costs **$225**. That's cheaper than an Apple Watch Series 11 ($399+) but more than budget fitness trackers. The pitch isn't features — Apple Watch has ECG, blood oxygen, temperature sensing, NFC payments, and a massive app ecosystem. Pebble has none of those.

The pitch is **philosophy**. A smartwatch should be a watch first. You glance at it — always-on display, no wrist twist needed. You charge it once a month. You get your notifications. You control your music. You don't get sucked into a tiny phone screen on your wrist. As one HN commenter put it: "Pebble seems to be the only watch company that understands what a smartwatch should be — why would I want phone-light on my wrist when my phone in my pocket can do it better?"

## Who Actually Wants This

People who've been wearing dead Pebbles for nine years and refusing to switch — and there are enough of them to sustain a volunteer infrastructure for nearly a decade. People who charge their Apple Watch every night and hate it. People who work with their hands (construction, cooking, gardening) and need physical buttons and sunlight-readable screens. Developers who want to build watchfaces for an open-source OS without Apple's or Google's permission. Anyone who thinks the best smartwatch is the one you forget you're wearing.

Production target: **500 watches per day** starting March 9. All pre-orders fulfilled by early June. If you've been waiting, the wait is almost over.
