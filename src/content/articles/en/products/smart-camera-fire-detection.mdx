## Prevention Over Detection
Most smart home cameras alert you after something has already happened — a break-in, a package theft, a fire. SafeSense, a new startup out of Berlin, is flipping the script with a camera that uses on-device ML to detect *precursors* to dangerous events.

## How It Works
The camera uses a custom vision model trained on thousands of hours of footage showing early signs of household hazards:
- **Smoke detection:** Identifies wisps of smoke before a fire alarm would trigger
- **Water leak detection:** Spots pooling water on floors using reflection analysis
- **Gas stove monitoring:** Tracks flame status and alerts if left unattended
- **Electrical hazard:** Detects sparking or overheating outlets via thermal patterns
All processing happens on a dedicated edge AI chip inside the camera. No footage leaves your home unless you explicitly choose to upload it.

> "We believe privacy and safety shouldn't be a trade-off. Everything runs locally." — SafeSense CEO

## Pricing and Availability
The SafeSense camera is priced at $129 with no subscription required. Pre-orders open in March 2026, with shipping expected in Q2.
