## A Complete SDR That Disappears Into Your Laptop

They crammed a complete software-defined radio — FPGA, transceiver, 2x2 MIMO, the works — into an **M.2 2230 card**. That's the same slot your laptop uses for WiFi. The xSDR measures 30 x 22 x 2 mm, sits on a single-sided PCB, and covers **30 MHz to 3.8 GHz**. Everything from HF amateur radio to LTE and low-band 5G, on something you could lose in your pocket.

Wavelet Lab's previous uSDR was already impressively small. The xSDR adds MIMO support and doubles down on the "disappearing radio" concept: plug it into a Framework 16 expansion bay or any M.2-equipped edge device, and you have a full SDR station with no external hardware visible.

## What You Can Actually Do With It

The AMD Artix-7 FPGA at the heart of xSDR is the same family used in test equipment costing 10x more — and here it's sharing a card smaller than a stick of gum with a Lime Microsystems LMS7002M transceiver. The bandwidth goes up to 90 MHz instantaneous, which means you can capture an entire FM broadcast band or a full LTE channel in one shot.

Pair it with a Raspberry Pi and you get a remotely accessible SDR station — Wavelet Lab's **wsdr.io** lets you control the radio from a browser. Plug two modules into the same system and you have a **4x4 MIMO** setup for serious cellular research. The entire software stack is open-source: MIT-licensed host libraries, CERN-OHL-P-2.0 gateware, and compatibility with **GNU Radio**, **SoapySDR**, and **srsRAN** out of the box.

## What the RF Community Is Saying

Over on the Framework Community forums, user Korvin captured the most exciting use case: an SDR that literally lives inside your laptop. "Previously our community showed a decent interest in embeddable SDRs," they wrote, calling the xSDR "an ideal candidate to be placed inside a Framework 16" — though they noted the **$549 price tag** makes it "definitely not an everyone's choice."

On the RTL-SDR blog, a commenter saw a different angle: "You could probably build an extremely capable radio by combining it with a Raspberry Pi, an up/downconverter for HF, and some amplifiers — for a fraction of the cost of what FlexRadio provides." For context, FlexRadio's comparable products run $2,000 to $6,000+.

The Hacker News thread has been quieter — the campaign is barely two weeks old — but the Crowd Supply page is live and the SDR community is still evaluating.

## Price and the Competition

At **$549** for the module (plus $89 for a breakout board with SMA cables), the xSDR isn't impulse-buy territory. But consider what it replaces: the **USRP B210** has similar specs, costs twice as much, and is the size of a paperback book. The **LimeSDR Mini 2.0** is cheaper but trades away MIMO and the Artix-7's FPGA flexibility. Nothing else in this price range fits in an M.2 slot.

Shipping is estimated for **July 2026** via Crowd Supply. This is crowdfunding, so the usual caveats apply — but Wavelet Lab shipped the uSDR successfully, which is more track record than most hardware campaigns can claim.

## Who Would Actually Want This

A ham radio operator who wants a portable HF-to-UHF station that disappears into a laptop. A cellular researcher who needs MIMO captures in the field without lugging a USRP. A penetration tester building a discreet RF toolkit. A satellite tracker who needs wideband reception on a drone or remote site. Anyone building a permanent monitoring station where space and power are constrained — the xSDR sips 2.85 to 5.5V and needs no fans.

If you've ever thought "I wish my SDR was smaller," this is the answer.
