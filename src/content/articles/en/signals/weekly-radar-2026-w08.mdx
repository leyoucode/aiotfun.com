## 1. Avalue Drops a Mini-ITX Board With 180 TOPS of AI Compute

Avalue's new EMX-PTLP is a thin mini-ITX motherboard powered by Intel's Core Ultra 7 358H — a Panther Lake-H SoC packing up to **180 TOPS** of NPU performance. Two years ago, you needed a full rack server for that kind of AI inference throughput. Now it fits in a standard mini-ITX enclosure designed for factory floors and kiosks. The edge AI hardware race just got another serious contender.

## 2. Pebble Smartwatch Is Actually Coming Back

Remember Pebble? The beloved e-ink smartwatch that Fitbit acquired and shut down in 2016? The rePebble project has been working on bringing it back, and their February production update shows real progress — actual hardware prototypes, factory tooling, and software milestones. This isn't vaporware. For the wearable-hacker crowd who never stopped missing their Pebble Time, this is the update they've been waiting for.

## 3. Chinese Scientists Achieve Fiber-Wireless 6G Fusion, Published in Nature

Chinese researchers have demonstrated the world's first cross-network fusion between fiber-optic and wireless communication systems. Their self-developed "fiber-wireless integrated communication system" set new data transmission speed records. The results were published in *Nature* on February 19 — which means this isn't a press release claim but peer-reviewed, journal-grade research. When 6G papers land in Nature, pay attention.

## 4. NVIDIA Teases "Never Before Seen" Chips Ahead of GTC 2026

Jensen Huang is at it again. Ahead of GTC 2026's March 15 keynote, NVIDIA's CEO promised **"multiple world-first new chips"** and declared that **"all technology has reached its limits."** When the CEO of the world's most valuable chip company says tech has hit its limits, he's either setting up an impressive reveal or managing expectations. Given NVIDIA's GTC track record, bet on the former. Mark your calendar: March 15, San Jose.

## 5. Mimiclaw: Another ESP32-S3 AI Assistant Enters the Chat

Hot on the heels of PicoClaw (which we covered running on just 10MB of RAM), Mimiclaw brings the OpenClaw AI assistant experience to ESP32-S3 boards. It handles the usual assistant tasks — email, calendar, messaging — but targets the massive installed base of ESP32 dev boards. If PicoClaw is about pushing the limits of RISC-V, Mimiclaw is about meeting makers where they already are. Two very different philosophies, same goal: personal AI on dirt-cheap hardware.
