This week on AIoTFun: two boards that shouldn't be possible, a smartwatch resurrection, a warzone hack, a radio in a WiFi slot, an open-source watch OS update, and a reality check on edge AI hardware. Seven stories, one thread — the hardware is getting ridiculous, and people are building ridiculous things with it.

## 1. PicoClaw: AI Assistant on 10MB of RAM

An AI personal assistant that handles email, calendar, and messaging — on a $15 RISC-V board with just 10MB of RAM. That's less memory than a single browser tab. It boots in one second and doesn't need a cloud connection.

## 2. Olimex ESP32-P4-PC: A $29 Board with More USB Than a MacBook Air

ESP32's most powerful chip gets a proper PC layout — HDMI output, four USB ports, Ethernet, camera connector, and battery UPS. All for $29. It runs Quake. And the missing Wi-Fi? That's a deliberate design decision.

## 3. Ukraine LoRa: Smart Home That Survives Blackouts

When Russia knocked out Ukraine's power grid, one developer kept their Home Assistant running over LoRa mesh networking. No internet, no power grid, no problem. Meshtastic nodes on solar power, controlling lights and sensors across a war zone.

## 4. xSDR: A Full SDR in an M.2 2230 Slot

A complete software-defined radio — FPGA-powered, 2x2 MIMO, 30 MHz to 3.8 GHz — crammed into a module the size of a WiFi card. It plugs into your laptop's M.2 slot. From FM radio to cellular, one tiny board does it all.

## 5. rePebble: The Smartwatch That Wouldn't Die

Pebble was killed in 2016. Volunteers kept the dead watches running for nine years. Now the original founder is back with rePebble — 30-day battery life, production starting March 9. The most dedicated hardware community we've ever seen gets rewarded.

## 6. AsteroidOS 2.0: Open-Source Watch OS Hits 30 Devices

Ten years in the making, this Linux-based smartwatch operating system just landed a major update. Always-on display, heart rate monitoring, 49 languages, and support for 30 watch models. Open-source communities play the long game — and sometimes they win.

## 7. The Great Edge AI Debate: Ready or Not?

180 TOPS on a mini-ITX board. AI assistants on 10MB of RAM. The silicon specs are wild. But can you actually ship production products with this stuff? We put the bulls and the bears in the ring.

**This week's thread:** Edge AI hardware and wearables are both having a moment — but from opposite directions. The hardware side is racing to pack more TOPS into smaller form factors, while the wearable side is proving that less is more (10MB of RAM, e-ink displays, mesh radios). The common denominator? Engineers who refuse to accept "you can't do that on this hardware." We'll see if that stubbornness pays off.
