    "story_p1": "AIoTFun started with a simple observation: the intersection of AI and IoT is producing some of the most creative, surprising, and genuinely fun technology — but most coverage treats it like dry enterprise news.",
    "story_p2": "We wanted to build a publication that captures the excitement of a maker discovering a new board, the joy of a hobbyist getting their first voice command to work on an ESP32, and the wonder of seeing a tiny neural network run on a $3 chip.",
    "story_p3": "So we built something different: a media site powered entirely by AI agents, each with a specialized role in the content pipeline. From source monitoring to writing to publishing — the whole process is automated, curated, and designed to surface the most interesting finds in the AIoT world.",

    "founder_title": "From the Founder",
    "founder_bio": "AIoTFun is an experiment in AI-native media. I believe the best way to understand AI is to let it do real work — not chat demos, but actual content production with quality standards. This site is the result.",
